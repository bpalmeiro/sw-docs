NEXUS
=====

NEXUS stands for *NEXt Utility for Simulation* and can be found on Github as `next-exp/nexus <https://github.com/next-exp/nexus>`_.

**Language**: C++, Geant4; **Based**: Geant4 toolkit, divided in logical blocks.

This section is focused on reviewing how the code is structured and where the installation guides can be found.

.. note::
  The main NEXUS documentation can be found on the `Wiki <https://github.com/next-exp/nexus/wiki>`_  of its Github repository.

Code
------------

NEXUS code is `structured <https://github.com/next-exp/nexus/wiki>`_  in a set of common tools (basic geometries, physics lists, materials database, etc)
to ensure data consistency to be easily extended to include new geometries
and configurations. NEXUS is written in C++, and depends on the following third-party libraries:

 * **Geant4**: NEXT simulations are based on Geant4.
 * **ROOT** (only up to v7_00_00): used for I/O and histogramming.
 * **gsl**: NEXUS depends on the GNU Scientific Library for the simulation of double beta decay events.
 * **hdf5**: output files are written as hdf5.

Important information about NEXUS code:
 * `User-guide <https://github.com/next-exp/nexus/wiki/User-guide>`_ can be found on the NEXUS Wiki.
 * A summary of the `output format <https://github.com/next-exp/nexus/wiki/Output-format>`_ can also be found there.
 * Examples of output format are uploaded on doc-db in `NEXT-doc-1313-v1 <https://next.ific.uv.es/cgi-bin/DocDB/private/ShowDocument?docid=1313>`_ .
 * A basic tutorial on Geant4 and nexus can be found in `NEXT-doc-1328-v2 <https://next.ific.uv.es/cgi-bin/DocDB/private/ShowDocument?docid=1328>`_ and `NEXT-doc-1329-v2 <https://next.ific.uv.es/cgi-bin/DocDB/private/ShowDocument?docid=1329>`_.

Tags
------------
A list of the different NEXUS `tags <https://github.com/next-exp/nexus/wiki/Tags>`_ can be found on the Wiki.
Starting from nexus tag v7_00_00, Geant4 version >= 11.0 is needed:

For previous nexus tags,  ROOT >= 6.26 must be used.

 .. note::
   Geant4 version 10.7.x cannot be used with any nexus tag or even commit. For previous tags, Geant4.10.6 or Geant4.10.5 were used.
